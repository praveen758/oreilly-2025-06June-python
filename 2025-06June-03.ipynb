    "\n",
    "When computers were first invented, each was for solving a single problem. If you had a new problem, you created a new computer to solve it. That was very inefficient!\n",
    "\n",
    "Then computers got more sophisticated -- they could solve multiple problems. You just needed to change the instructions, which were written in binary code (1s and 0s). But writing with 1s and 0s is really tedious and error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step was to write programming languages. You write in a higher-level language, and it is translated into 1s and 0s. Some early famous languages were Fortran, PL/1, Lisp, and eventually C and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some are very similar to the 1s and 0s, so they run very very fast -- but they are hard for people to write (and read, and debug). Others are very high level, meaning that they're similar to how people think and write, but those typically run much slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very high-level language. It's designed for readability and maintainability, not for speed. The biggest bottleneck in software today is the speed with which people can write and then maintain code. (Maintenance is more important!) The fact that computers are very cheap nowadays, but people cost a lot to write/maintain software, gives Python and edge. We can pay more for hardware, and spend less on people, because they'll get more done in less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is 30 years old, but is now very popular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The #1 langauge for data science and machine learning\n",
    "- Also very popular for analyzing data\n",
    "- Web applications\n",
    "- API services and consumption\n",
    "- Automated testing\n",
    "- Education\n",
    "\n",
    "The only places where Python isn't a good fit (right now) would be:\n",

    "- mobile applications\n",
    "- where speed is of the essence\n",
    "\n",
    "Many \"intro Python\" courses assume that you have a background in other languages, so they can talk about \"strings\" and \"lists\" and \"functions\" and you know what they mean. This course will try not to do that!"
