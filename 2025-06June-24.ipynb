    "- If you have several parts of your program that are roughly the same, replace them with a function.\n",

    "This means that we can define a function a single time, and then use it many times. This has a bunch of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we need to modify our function (and we will!) then it's easier to change it in one place\n",

    "\n",
    "The difference between treating a function as a verb and a noun is the `()`. If you use `()` after a function's name, that means: Execute/call this function, and show me the result. But if you don't use `()`, then you end up with the function definition, which will almost certainly give you a different result than you wanted. Think of the function object/value as the blueprints to a house, and the executing function as the house itself -- both important, but not the same thing."
